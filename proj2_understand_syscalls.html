<h1>Understanding System Calls</h1>

<p>

In this document, we walk through the functions and steps that are
involved in (a) starting a user-level program, (b) handling system
calls in the OS, and (c) invoking system calls at the user-level.

</p><p> You should read this document together with the OS/161 source code files
that it refers to.  For maximum benefit, you should run OS/161 under the
control of the debugger, and be able to browse the source code, while working
through this document.


</p><p>
In a real
operating system, the kernel's main function is to provide support  for
user-level programs.  Most such support is accessed via "system calls." We
give you one system call, <tt>reboot()</tt>, which is implemented in the 
function <tt>sys_reboot()</tt> in <tt>src/kern/main/main.c</tt>. In GDB, if you put a breakpoint 
on <tt>sys_reboot</tt> and run the "reboot" program (by typing "p /sbin/reboot" at the OS/161 menu prompt), 
you can use "backtrace" to see how it got there. 

</p><p><b>User level programs</b>

</p><p>
Our System/161 simulator can run normal programs compiled from C. The
programs are compiled with a cross-compiler, <tt>cs161-gcc</tt>. 
This compiler runs on the host machine and produces MIPS executables; it is 
the same compiler used to compile the OS/161 kernel. To create new 
user programs, you will need to edit the Makefile in <tt>bin</tt>, 
<tt>sbin</tt>, or <tt>testbin</tt> (depending on where you
put your programs) and then create a directory similar to those that
already exist.  Use an existing program and its Makefile as a template.
You will want to create new user-level test programs that use the system
calls you are adding.


</p><p><b>Getting to user-mode (starting a user-level program)</b>

</p><p> Examine <tt>kern/main/menu.c</tt> to see how the "p" menu command
is handled.  This command allows us to load and execute a single
user-level program.  We will describe this in great detail, most
of which is not of critical importance for this assignment.  You will need to
understand this eventually, however, and the sooner the better.

</p><p> The <tt>menu()</tt> function loops forever printing the menu prompt,
getting a string from the console, and calling <tt>menu_execute</tt> 
to handle the input.  Looking at <tt>menu_execute</tt>, we see that 
it separates the input into individual commands (indicated by a semi-colon)
and then calls <tt>cmd_dispatch</tt> for each command.  In <tt>cmd_dispatch</tt>,
the name of the command is separated from its arguments, and the name is
looked up in the <tt>cmdtable</tt> data structure.  This table stores
the string name of each menu command and a function pointer to the 
function that should handle that command.

</p><p> Looking at the <tt>cmdtable</tt> declaration, we find that the
"p" command is handled by calling the <tt>cmd_prog</tt> function.
This function simply strips off the "p" part and passes the rest
of the input to the <tt>common_prog</tt> function.  Looking at
<tt>common_prog</tt> we see that it calls <tt>thread_fork</tt>,
creating a new thread to run the specified user-level program.
Following this call to thread_fork, our system has 2 threads - the initial boot
thread that runs the menu() loop, and this new thread that runs the
requested user-level program.  You can look at <tt>kern/thread/thread.c</tt> to
see what thread_fork() does, but the important thing right now is that
the fourth argument to thread_fork specifies the function that the
new thread should start executing (in this case, <tt>cmd_progthread</tt>), 
and the second and third arguments to thread_fork are the arguments to pass to 
that function (in this case, the name of the program to load).  
The <tt>cmd_progthread</tt> function calls <tt>runprogram</tt>, passing
it the name of the program to load and execute.  Note that if runprogram
is successful, the thread will continue with the execution of the user-level
program and will never return to <tt>cmd_progthread</tt>.
Now let's consider how <tt>runprogram</tt> operates.
 
</p><p>The <tt>kern/userprog</tt> directory contains the files that are
responsible for the loading and running of user-level programs.
Currently, the only files in the directory are <tt>loadelf.c</tt>,
<tt>runprogram.c</tt>, and <tt>uio.c</tt>.  (During this assignment,
you should add the file simple_syscalls.c to this directory.)
Understanding these files will be very important in future assignments,
but for the time being, a basic understanding of how a user program is 
loaded and executed is sufficient. 


</p><p><tt>runprogram.c</tt>:
This file contains only one function, <tt>runprogram()</tt>, which is 
responsible for running a program from the kernel menu.  It uses the
virtual file system operations to open the file containing the program
we want to load, creates an address space for the thread, and loads
the program into that address space, using the <tt>load_elf</tt> function.
If loading the program is successful, <tt>runprogram</tt> then sets up the user stack area in
the address space, and calls <tt>md_usermode</tt> to switch to
user mode and start running the user program. (You will be learning more about how
 <tt>md_usermode</tt> works later this term.  Essentially, it does some setup so that
 a "return from exception" takes control to the entry point of the user program, even
 though we did not enter the kernel through an exception.)

 </p><p> Other files in the userprog directory:

 </p><p><tt>loadelf.c</tt>:
 This file contains the functions responsible for loading an ELF executable
 from the filesystem and into virtual memory space.  (ELF is the name
 of the executable format produced by <tt>cs161-gcc</tt>.)
 Of course, at this point this virtual memory space does not provide what
 is normally meant by virtual memory -- although there is translation
 between the addresses that executables "believe" they are using and
 physical addresses, there is no mechanism for providing more memory
 than exists physically.  We recommend not stressing about this until
 Assignment 3.

 </p><p><tt>uio.c</tt>:
 This file contains functions for moving data between kernel and user
 space.  Knowing when and how to cross this boundary is critical to
 properly implementing userlevel programs, so this is a good file to read
 very carefully. You should also examine the code in
 <tt>lib/copyinout.c</tt>.  You should be using <tt>copyinstr</tt>
 to get the string to be printed from the user address when implementing
 the final system call.

 </p><p> Once a user program is running, it requests service from the OS using
 system calls.  We now take a closer look at these.

 </p><p><b>Getting to system mode:  traps and syscalls (kern/arch/mips/mips)</b>

 </p><p>
 Exceptions are the key to operating systems; they are the mechanism
 that enables the OS to regain control of execution and therefore do
 its job.  You can think of exceptions as the interface between the
 processor and the operating system. When the OS boots, it installs an
 "exception handler" (carefully crafted assembly code) at a specific
 address in memory.  When the processor raises an exception, it invokes
 this, which sets up a "trap frame" and calls into the operating
 system.  The business of initializing the trap frame and returning
 from an exception is all done in assembly code, and can be found in
 <tt>kern/arch/mips/mips/exception.S</tt>.  You don't need to be able
 to read MIPS assembly code, but the comments in this file are
 reasonably good.  You can see how all the registers are saved ("sw" ==
 "store word"), followed by a call to the <tt>mips_trap</tt> function
 ("jal" == "jump and link" == function call).  On return from
 <tt>mips_trap</tt>, all of the saved state is restored ("lw" == "load
 word") and execution resumes at the point where the exception
 occurred.

 </p><p> Looking at the definition of <tt>struct trapframe</tt> in
 <tt>kern/arch/mips/include</tt>, we can see that a trap frame includes
 space to save all the processor registers that the user program might
 have been using, as well as some additional state that identifies the
 cause of the exception (the "tf_cause" field), and the instruction
 that was being executed when the exception occurred (the "tf_epc"
 field -- note that epc == "Exception PC" == contents of the program
 counter register when the exception occurred).  

 </p><p> Note that since "exception" is
 such an overloaded term in computer science, operating system lingo for
 an exception is a "trap" -- when the OS traps execution.  Interrupts are
 exceptions, and more significantly for this assignment, so are system
 calls.  Specifically, <tt>syscall.c</tt> handles traps that happen to 
 be system calls. 

 </p><p>
 <tt>mips_trap()</tt> in <tt>kern/arch/mips/mips/trap.c</tt> is the key
 function for returning control to the operating system. This is the C
 function that gets called by the assembly language exception handler.  It
 includes code to determine what type of exception occurred, and to
 dispatch an appropriate handler.  If the exception code is
 <tt>EX_SYS</tt>, then <tt>mips_syscall</tt> is called to handle the
 system call, passing it the trapframe.


 </p><p>
 <tt>mips_syscall()</tt> in <tt>kern/arch/mips/mips/syscall.c</tt> is the
 function that delegates the actual work of a system call to the kernel
 function that implements it. <font color="red">Read the comments at the top of this file
   carefully!</font>  In <tt>mips_syscall</tt>, we begin by
 extracting the system call number from the trapframe's <tt>tf_v0</tt>
 field.  This means that the system call number was stored in register
 v0 prior to executing the <tt>syscall</tt> instruction.  Then we
 simply switch on the system call number, with a separate "case" to
 handle each possible system call.  Notice that <tt>reboot()</tt> is
 the only case currently handled.  These system call numbers are all
 defined in <tt>kern/include/kern/callno.h</tt>.  You should add new
 entries to this file for the system calls that you are creating for
 this assignment.

 </p><p> Following the switch statement, we prepare to return from the system call.
 The user-level side of the system call expects to find the result of the 
 system call in register v0, with register a3 indicating whether or not
 an error occurred.  We accomplish this by setting the appropriate fields in
 the trapframe, which will be loaded into the machine registers before returning
 control to the user program.  Finally, we have to advance the program counter 
 to the next instruction, so that the <tt>syscall</tt> instruction will not be
 repeated.  This is done by incrementing the <tt>tf_epc</tt> field of the 
 trapframe.  

 </p><p> <b> The user-level side of a system call </b>

 </p><p> Ok, so that's what happens on the OS side when a system call occurs.
 Now let's look at the user level interface to system calls.  Most of this
 will be encapsulated in C library functions.

 </p><p><tt>src/lib/libc/</tt>: This is the user-level C library. There's obviously 
 a lot of code here. We don't expect you to read it all,
 although it may be instructive in the long run to do so.  Job interviewers
 have an uncanny habit of asking people to implement standard C library
 functions on the whiteboard.  For present purposes you need only look
 at the code that implements the user-level side of system calls, which
 we detail below.

 </p><p><tt>errno.c</tt>:
 This is where the global variable errno is defined.  Note that this variable
 is a global within a user-level C program.  <b>You cannot set errno for a user-level
   program by setting a variable named "errno" in the kernel</b>.

 </p><p><tt>syscalls-mips.S</tt>: This file contains the machine-dependent
 code necessary for implementing the user-level side of MIPS system
 calls.  It consists of a C pre-processor "define" that declares the
 body of each system call. The body of each system call is identical,
 except that a different system call number "num" is used.  This body
 simply loads the system call number (as defined in callno.h) into
 register v0 and then jumps to the code common to all system calls at
 the <tt>__syscall</tt> label. (Compare this with the OS side where the
 system call number is extracted from the "tf_v0" field of the
 trapframe).  

 </p><p> You may notice that it looks like the code jumps to the <tt>__syscall</tt>
 label <i>before</i> setting the system call number.  This is just a
 peculiarlity of the MIPS architecture -- the instruction immediately following a branch
 is called a "delay slot" which means that an instruction can be scheduled and
 executed <i>during</i> a branch.  Such instructions appear immediately
 after the branch instruction itself.  Thus, the "<tt>addiu v0, $0,
   SYS_##sym</tt>" happens before we get to the common syscall code at
 the label <tt>__syscall</tt>.  Try not to be too disturbed by this.

 </p><p>Look now at the assembly code at the <tt>__syscall</tt> label.

 </p><p> The common system call code begins with the <tt>syscall</tt> instruction, which
 causes a "system call exception" and transfers control to the OS as outlined above.
 The "tf_epc" field in the trapframe on the OS side points to this instruction, and
 we finish our system call handler by setting "tf_epc" to the next instruction, so
 on return from the system call we execute the "beq" instruction.  This instruction
 tests if the system call failed or succeeded (recall the system side sets "tf_a3"
 to 1 on error, and 0 on success).  If an error occurred, we take the error code
 from the v0 register and store it into the global variable errno, and set the
 return value of the system call (the v0 register) to "-1".  If no error occurred,
 then the OS put the result of the system call into "tf_v0" and we can just return.

 </p><p><tt>syscalls.S</tt>: This file is created from syscalls-mips.S at
 compile time and is the actual file assembled into the C library.  The
 actual names of the system calls are placed in this file using a
 script called <tt>callno-parse.sh</tt> that reads them from the
 kernel's header files.  This avoids having to make a second list of
 the system calls.  In a real system, typically each system call stub
 is placed in its own source file, to allow selectively linking them
 in.  OS/161 puts them all together to simplify the makefiles.  Adding
 new entries to callno.h automatically causes new user-level system
 call procedures to be defined when you re-build the user-level code.
 Each "SYSCALL(name,num)" macro statement in this file is expanded by
 the C pre-processor into a declaration of the appropriate system call
 function.

 </p><p><tt>src/include/unistd.h</tt>:
 The file <tt>include/unistd.h</tt> contains the user-level interface
 definition of the system calls for OS/161 (including ones you will
 implement in later assignments).  <font color="red">The only thing you need to do to
   complete the user-level system call interface is declare prototypes
   for your new system calls in <tt>unistd.h</tt></font>.  Everything else
 (on the user side) happens automatically when you re-build after updating
 callno.h.

 </p><p> Note that the user-level interface defined in unistd.h is
 different from that of the kernel functions that you will define to
 implement these calls.  You need to declare the kernel functions in
 <tt>kern/include/syscall.h</tt>.   


 </p><p><b> Testing new system calls</b>

 </p><p> To test your new system calls, add new test programs to <tt>src/testbin</tt>.  Use the existing
 programs as a template.  

 As an example, you could use the following program to test the "helloworld()" system call:

 </p><pre>#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

int main()
{
	helloworld();
	return 0;
}
 </pre>
